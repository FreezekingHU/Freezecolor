Hello! 

This script lets you change the color of your car by typing /color for the primary and /color2 for the secondary color.

Here is an example to make it easy:

/color 255 0 0: Is going to be red

/color 0 255 0: Is going to be green

/color 0 0 255: Is going to be blue

Same with the secondary colors, but with the command /color2

Thank you for downloading my resource, I hope you find it helpful. May you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.
